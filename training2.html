                    <div><strong>For all of the following questions, please imagine the following scenario:</strong></div>
                    <div>You are an employee in a widget manufacturing plant, monitoring the output of a series of machines on the factory floor while completing other tasks. Your display reports each machine's output of parts per minute, or the number of parts each machine is producing every minute. Some machines may produce more parts than others, but most produce around 50 parts per minute. If a machine's output is too high or too low, the machine is no longer operating at acceptable levels and will need repair. But in order to avoid delays, you do not want to take a machine offline until absolutely necessary. You need to stay aware of the machines collectively and check on certain machines throughout the day.</div>
